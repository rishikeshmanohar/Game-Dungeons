# Game Dungeon

[**[Play Game!]**](https://game-dungeons.vercel.app/)

Game Dungeon is a fun 2D platformer game where you explore dungeons, jump over obstacles, and fight enemies. I'm making this game to learn Unity and get better at game development.

**What You Need:**
- Unity 6 (version 6000.0.32f1 or newer)


## How to Play

**Controls:**
- **A / Left Arrow** - Move left
- **D / Right Arrow** - Move right
- **Space / W / Up Arrow** - Jump
- **Click** - Interact with doors and buttons

**Game Goals:**
1. Use the arrow keys or A/D to move your character
2. Jump over spikes and obstacles to avoid taking damage
3. Defeat enemies by jumping on them
4. Collect coins and gems for points
5. Find the red door at the end of each level
6. Reach the door to complete the level
