[**[Play Game!]**](https://game-dungeons.vercel.app/)

Game Dungeon is a fun 2D platformer game where you explore dungeons, jump over obstacles, and fight enemies. I'm making this game to learn Unity and get better at game development.

**What You Need:**
- Unity 6 (version 6000.0.32f1 or newer)


## Assets Used

These are the sprite packs and graphics I used to make the game:
